There are two modes:-

* **`NORMAL`:** In this mode, all operators have every attachment unlocked (e.g., ACOG sight can be equipped on SMG-11).
* **`BALANCED`:** This mode ensures that all operators remain balanced as they were originally, without modifications.

## Pre-Loader

After you have selected the Mode, it will ask you which maps to Pre-Load

Pre-loading the maps will allow you to use different map objects in different map. The creator of custom maps mentions which maps you need to pre-load in order to play them.&#x20;

Just select the maps you want to pre-load and click the `PRELOAD` button.



You can open **console** by pressing `F1` and type help for all commands. You can open **editor** in-game by pressing `F3`.
